# StickMan
This 3D Stickman has been rigged with Mixamo and can be applied on top of any other Mixamo rig.

The rig has a hands and feet IK/FK switch for both complicated and basic movements, and a foot roll bone.

The body is fully rigged and can move in any direction.

Creating and rigging your own stickman is very time-consuming and rather boring, so don't lose time and energy, this stickman is ready to use out of the box and can be easily transformed into any character.

For a better experience, it is recommended to have the Mixamo blender add-on installed.

Note : the fists can open and close, but the fingers are not rigged.
